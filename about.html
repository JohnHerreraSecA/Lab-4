        Born amidst the vibrant sprawl of Los Angeles, with its palm-lined streets and kaleidoscope of cultures, I found myself immersed in a tapestry of diversity from the very beginning. Yet, it was the move to Toronto during my formative years that truly shaped my identity. Nestled within the welcoming embrace of Canada's largest city, I discovered a new rhythm of life amidst its bustling streets and friendly neighborhoods. The juxtaposition of my birthplace's sun-soaked energy with Toronto's multicultural mosaic instilled in me a deep appreciation for both the dynamic allure of the West Coast and the inclusive warmth of the Great White North. From the palm trees of LA to the maple leaves of Toronto, my upbringing straddled two worlds, enriching my perspective and fueling my curiosity about the rich tapestry of human experience.
